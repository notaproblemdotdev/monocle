# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-09
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 15

## Overview

A unified terminal dashboard that aggregates work items and pull/merge requests from Jira, GitLab (and future GitHub) into a single view. Built with the Textual framework, it calls existing CLI tools (gh, glab, acli) that are already authenticated, providing a cohesive view of what the user needs to work on across Jira, GitHub, and GitLab.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal:** Solid async infrastructure and validated data models that can parse CLI outputs without blocking

**Depends on:** Nothing (first phase)

**Requirements:** DATA-03, ASYNC-01, ASYNC-02, ASYNC-03, ASYNC-04, TEST-01

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Async subprocess calls complete without blocking the main thread
2. Workers use exclusive=True to prevent race conditions when multiple fetches run
3. Pydantic models validate and parse JSON from gh/glab/acli CLI outputs
4. Failed CLI calls raise exceptions with descriptive error messages (no silent failures)
5. Unit tests exist for all Pydantic models with valid and invalid input cases

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — UV project init, Ruff/MyPy/pytest setup, directory structure
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Pydantic models for MR/PR and Issue data structures
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Async subprocess utilities with Textual Workers API, error handling

**Details:**
Foundation phase established the core infrastructure: UV project configuration with Ruff/MyPy/pytest, Pydantic models for data structures (MergeRequest, JiraWorkItem), and async subprocess utilities with Textual Workers API integration.

### Phase 2: CLI Adapters

**Goal:** Detect installed CLIs and fetch real data from GitLab and Jira with proper authentication handling

**Depends on:** Phase 1

**Requirements:** DASH-04, DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-04, DATA-05, CONFIG-01, CONFIG-02, TEST-02

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Application detects presence of glab and acli CLIs on startup
2. GitLab MRs are fetched via glab --json and include: MR number, title, status, author, URL
3. Jira work items are fetched via acli --json and include: issue key, title, status, priority, URL
4. Unauthenticated or missing CLIs result in hidden sections (no crashes, no prompts)
5. All CLI calls use existing authentication (no separate auth flow in the app)
6. Async tests verify each CLI adapter handles success, auth failure, and network errors

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — CLI detection mechanism and base adapter enhancements
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — GitLab glab adapter with MR fetching
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Jira acli adapter with work item fetching

**Details:**
CLI Adapters phase built the data source layer: CLI detection mechanism (CLIDetector, DetectionRegistry), GitLab adapter for merge requests, and Jira adapter for work items. Auto-detection of installed CLIs with graceful handling for missing/unauthenticated tools.

### Phase 3: Dashboard UI

**Goal:** A responsive two-section dashboard with keyboard navigation and browser integration

**Depends on:** Phase 2

**Requirements:** DASH-01, DASH-02, DASH-03, DASH-05, DATA-06, TEST-03

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Dashboard renders with two sections: PRs/MRs on top, Work Items below
2. Each section shows a loading spinner while fetching data
3. User can navigate items with j/k or arrow keys within each section
4. User can press 'o' to open the selected item in their default browser
5. Each item displays: Key + Title + Status + Priority in a consistent format
6. UI remains responsive during data fetching (no freezing)
7. Integration tests verify widget behavior using Textual's Pilot class

**Plans:** 7 plans (3 original + 2 gap closure + 2 UAT fixes)

Plans:

- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Create DataTable section widgets (MergeRequestSection, WorkItemSection)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Build main screen with 50/50 layout and async data fetching
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Implement keyboard navigation and browser integration
- [x] 03-04-PLAN.md — Fix Textual workers API (replace deprecated @work decorator)
- [x] 03-05-PLAN.md — Fix acli auth check command (replace invalid whoami command)
- [x] 03-06-PLAN.md — Fix UI/Layout issues (header, spinner centering, MR order)
- [x] 03-07-PLAN.md — Fix keyboard navigation issues (o key, Tab focus, q quit)

**Details:**
Dashboard UI phase delivered the TUI: DataTable widgets with loading states, 50/50 main screen layout with async fetching, and full keyboard navigation (Tab switching, j/k/arrows, 'o' for browser). Gap closure work fixed Textual 7.x migration, auth command issues, and UAT-discovered bugs.

### Phase 4: Add Logging

**Goal:** Add proper logging infrastructure to the application for debugging and monitoring

**Depends on:** Phase 3

**Requirements:** LOG-01, LOG-02

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Application uses structlog for structured logging
2. Logs are written to both console and file
3. Log level is configurable
4. Sensitive data is not logged
5. Debug mode flag enables verbose logging

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Set up structlog for structured logging with console/file output
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Fix asyncio subprocess race condition with semaphore

**Details:**
Added structured logging with structlog: JSON output to file for analysis, human-readable console output, configurable log levels via LOG_LEVEL env var, --debug CLI flag, and sensitive data filtering. Fixed asyncio subprocess race condition with Semaphore(3) for stability.

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**

None (standard integer phase numbering used throughout)

**Key Decisions:**

- Use Textual framework for TUI (modern async support)
- Shell out to existing CLIs vs APIs (reuse existing auth, simpler implementation)
- Per-section loading spinners for better UX
- 'o' key for opening browser (Vim-style convention)
- Two-section layout (PRs + Work Items) for logical grouping
- Auto-detect CLIs vs explicit config for zero-config experience
- UV for dependency management, Ruff for linting, MyPy for type checking
- Use structlog for structured JSON logging with processor chain
- asyncio.Semaphore(3) to limit concurrent subprocess execution

**Issues Resolved:**

- Textual 7.x migration: Migrated from deprecated @work decorator to run_worker() API
- acli auth command: Fixed incorrect whoami command to auth status
- asyncio subprocess race condition: Added semaphore to prevent InvalidStateError
- UAT gaps: Fixed RowKey.value handling, focus_table() for proper focus, 'q' key binding

**Issues Deferred:**

- GitHub support (CLI adapter needed)
- Refresh capability (r/F5 key)
- Search/filter functionality (/ key)
- Help screen (? key)
- Configuration file support

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Some type check warnings in test files (HttpUrl string literals)
- Section widget inheritance could be refactored for cleaner state management
- CLI adapters share similar patterns that could be abstracted further
