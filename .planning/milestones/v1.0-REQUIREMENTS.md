For current requirements, see `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (created for next milestone).

---

**Defined:** 2025-02-07
**Core Value:** One dashboard showing all assigned work items and pending MRs without switching between browser tabs or context switching between platforms.

## v1 Requirements (SHIPPED)

### Dashboard

- [x] **DASH-01**: Dashboard renders two-section layout (PRs/MRs section + Work Items section) — v1.0
- [x] **DASH-02**: User can navigate between items using keyboard (j/k or arrow keys) — v1.0
- [x] **DASH-03**: User can press 'o' to open selected item in default browser — v1.0
- [x] **DASH-04**: Application auto-detects which CLIs are installed (glab, acli) and shows only available sections — v1.0
- [x] **DASH-05**: Per-section loading spinners shown while fetching data — v1.0

### Data Sources

- [x] **DATA-01**: GitLab MRs fetched via glab CLI using --json flag — v1.0
- [x] **DATA-02**: Jira work items fetched via acli CLI using --json flag — v1.0
- [x] **DATA-03**: All CLI responses parsed and validated with Pydantic models — v1.0
- [x] **DATA-04**: GitLab MRs include: MR number, title, status, author, URL — v1.0
- [x] **DATA-05**: Jira work items include: issue key, title, status, priority, URL — v1.0
- [x] **DATA-06**: Display format for each item shows: Key + Title + Status + Priority — v1.0

### Async & Performance

- [x] **ASYNC-01**: Data fetching uses Textual Workers API with @work decorator — v1.0 (migrated to run_worker())
- [x] **ASYNC-02**: Workers use exclusive=True to prevent race conditions — v1.0
- [x] **ASYNC-03**: UI remains responsive during data fetching (non-blocking) — v1.0
- [x] **ASYNC-04**: Failed CLI calls handled gracefully with error messages — v1.0

### Configuration

- [x] **CONFIG-01**: Application uses existing CLI authentication (no separate auth) — v1.0

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| In-TUI code review/editing | Terminal is poor for these tasks; redirect to browser |
| Real-time notifications | Out of v1 scope; focus on on-demand dashboard |
| Custom theming | Standard Textual themes sufficient for MVP |
| Offline mode | Requires active internet to fetch data |
| Caching strategies | Fresh fetch on load; caching may be added in v2 |
| Non-terminal interfaces | TUI-only, no web or desktop versions |
| Modifying items from CLI | View-only in v1; editing via web interface |

**Adjusted:**
- ASYNC-01: Migrated from @work decorator to run_worker() API (Textual 7.x compatibility)
- Added LOG-01 and LOG-02 requirements during Phase 4 for production readiness

**Dropped:**
None — all requirements shipped as planned

**Out of Scope Validated:**
All out-of-scope decisions remain valid after shipping v1.0. No items need reconsideration for v2.
